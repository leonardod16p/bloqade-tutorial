# Introduction

When I first encountered the Bloqade API documentation, I found myself struggling to follow the guide to learn quantum programming. It seemed like I didnâ€™t understand almost anything I was doing. In this tutorial, I will show how I made progress. The best approach I found was to look up every expression that seemed obscure to me and then organize all that material in a structured way.

We will follow a bottom-up approach, covering the following topics:

> ## What do we gain compared to classical computing?
> ## Examples
> ## What would we like to know about our specific graph structure?
> ## Mathematical Modeling Problem
> ## Physical Model Problems
> ## Quantum Algorithms
> ## Theoretical Computation Model
> ## Physics

It is worth being a little more specific about this structure. I was somewhat comfortable with the circuit model of computation in quantum computing. It was, in fact, very similar to what I was used to doing with classical circuits.
