# Graph Theory

We are going to need some tools from theoretical mathematics. When dealing with a group of atoms and their interactions, we can think of them as graphs. In this context, the atoms in our physical system can be abstracted as vertices.

We are particularly interested in Rydberg states. In this case, the Rydberg interactions will dominate and effectively supersede all other interactions in our system. This dominance allows us to model the lattice by considering only these interactions as edges. As a result, our final graph will consist of a set of atoms (vertices) and the Rydberg interactions between them (edges).

To gain some intuition about this concept, I created a mini-project about graphs, which you can find in `examples/graphs`

The code contains examples of graph constructions based on the definitions provided in the following document: [Graph Theory Notes](https://math.gordon.edu/courses/mat230/handouts/graphs.pdf)
