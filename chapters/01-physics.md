# Quantum Mechanics

### What does it mean to prepare a state?
First of all, we need to clarify what it means to prepare a state. The first axiom does not specify the state space associated with our physical system, nor does it specify the state vector of that system. All the first axiom states is what every state space and state vector must satisfy.

Quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework. For our purposes, we will be dealing with atoms and light. Therefore, our state space will describe all the possible configurations involving atoms and light. Our state vector will represent one specific configuration of atoms and light.

We need to perform computations. As in classical computing, we want to control the input and how this input is transformed. This process must be **reproducible**. But can we achieve that in a realistic system? In fact, this is a hard problem. According to the No-Cloning Theorem, most states do not have a preparation procedure. Only a few can be prepared using a repeatable method.

# Condensed Matter

Condensed Matter is a field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter, especially the solid and liquid phases, which arise from electromagnetic forces between atoms and electrons. More generally, the subject deals with condensed phases of matter: systems composed of many constituents with strong interactions among them.

A phase transition is a physical process involving the transition between one state of a medium and another. In this context, a medium refers to a substance that can transmit energy, such as sound or light. The state of a medium can be described by its properties, like elasticity, inertia, and density, which affect how energy propagates through it.

Examples:
- Classical phase transitions (first-order)
- Second-order phase transitions
- Quantum phase transitions

Quantum transitions occur at zero Kelvin and are induced by changes in some non-thermal parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field.
